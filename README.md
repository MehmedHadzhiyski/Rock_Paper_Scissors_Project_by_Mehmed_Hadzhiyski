# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Project_by_Mehmed_Hadzhiyski🪨📄✂️
This project is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors console game

The user can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer, which is programmed to choose a number randomly from 1 to 3, of which:
 - 1 is "Rock" 🪨;
 - 2 is "Paper" 📄;
 - 3 is "Scissors" ✂️.

The user can choose "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" as input and based on his/her choice the program checks if the user wins, draws or loses against the computer.
There are also a score system to show the user's and computer's score and colorful texts as outputs 🤩.
